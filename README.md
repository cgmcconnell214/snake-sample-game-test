## Required environment variables

Several Supabase Edge functions depend on environment variables for Supabase and Stripe access. Create a `.env` file in the `supabase` directory with at least the following keys:

```
SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-service-role-key>
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your-stripe-secret-key>
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<your-stripe-webhook-secret>
```

Make sure these are set when deploying functions so the API calls succeed.

## Twoâ€‘factor authentication

The `TwoFactorManager` component now generates a secure TOTP secret using browser crypto and verifies tokens locally. When enabling 2FA, scan the displayed OTP URL with an authenticator app and enter the generated code to complete setup.
